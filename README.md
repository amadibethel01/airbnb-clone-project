### 🧠 Why It's Important to Identify Design Properties from a Mockup

Identifying design properties in a mockup is essential because:

- 🧩 **Maintains visual consistency:** Ensures components across the app look and feel the same  
- 📐 **Accelerates frontend development:** Developers know exactly what fonts, sizes, and colors to apply  
- ♿ **Supports accessibility and usability:** Proper use of color contrast and font sizing helps all users  
- 🧑‍🎨 **Bridges designer-developer collaboration:** Reduces misinterpretation and guesswork between design and code  
- 🚀 **Ensures brand coherence:** Makes the application look professional and aligned with product identity
